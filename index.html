            <p>
                I had a dream last night
                That I was piloting a plane
                And all the passengers were drunk and insane
                I crash landed in Louisiana swamp
                Shot up a horde of zombies
                But I come out on top
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse" id="verse-2">
            <p>
                What’s it all about?
                It just reflects my mood
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse" id="verse-3">
            <p>
                Sitting in the dirt
                Feeling kind of hurt
                All I hear is doom and gloom
                All is darkness in my room
                Through the light your face I see
                Baby, take a chance
                Baby, won’t you dance with me
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse" id="verse-4">
            <p>
                Lost all that treasure in an overseas war
                It just goes to show you don’t get what you paid for
                Battle to the rich and you worry about the poor
                Put my feet up on the couch
                And lock all the doors
                Hear a funky noise tightening of the screws
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse" id="verse-5">
            <p>
                Feeling kind of hurt
                Sitting in the dirt
                All I hear is doom and gloom
                But when those drums go boom, boom, boom,
                Through the night your face I see
                Baby, take a chance
                Baby, won’t you dance with me
                Yeah, baby won’t you dance with me
                Ah, yeah!

                Fracking deep for there’s oil on the sump
                There’s kids all pick at the garbage dump
                I’m running out of water so I better prime the pump
                I am trying to stay sober but I end up drunk
                We’ll be eating dirt
                Living on the side of the road
                There’s some food for thought
                Kind of makes your head explode
            </p>

        <div class="verse" id="verse-7">
            <p>

                Through the night your face I see
                Baby, come on, dance with me
                Baby, won’t you dance with me
                Feeling kind of hurt
                Baby, won’t you dance with me
                Ah, yeah!
                Come on, dance with me
